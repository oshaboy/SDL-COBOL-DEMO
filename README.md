# SDL COBOL DEMO
 A basic SDL demo, but written in Cobol because I am a masochist. 
 
 All it does is draw lines in random colors in random positions. The only semi-impressive thing about it is the tricks I pulled to interface SDL2 and GNU Cobol.  
 To compile under *nix simply install SDL2 (+headers) and GNU Cobol and run the included compile.sh script.   
 I have no clue how to compile this under Windows.
